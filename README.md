![Build Status](https://github.com/buu342/N64-UNFLoader/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg) [![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/buu342/buu342/_apis/build/status/buu342.N64-UNFLoader?branchName=master)](https://dev.azure.com/buu342/buu342/_build/latest?definitionId=1&branchName=master)

**The code in this repo might be unstable! For stable releases, head to the [releases page](https://github.com/buu342/N64-UNFLoader/releases)**

UNFLoader is a USB ROM uploader (and debugging) tool designed to unify developer flashcarts for the Nintendo 64. The goal of this project is to provide developers with USB I/O functions that work without needing to worry about the target flashcart, provided by a single C file (`usb.c`) targeting both libultra and libdragon. A very basic debug library (`debug.c`) that makes use of said USB library is also provided.

Currently supported flashcarts:
* 64Drive Hardware 1.0 (No longer comercially sold), using firmware 2.05+
* [64Drive Hardware 2.0](http://64drive.retroactive.be/), using firmware 2.05+
* EverDrive 3.0 (No longer comercially sold), using OS version 3.04+ (Please note that OS v3.07 onwards is **not** compatible with the 3.0).
* [EverDrive X7](https://krikzz.com/store/home/55-everdrive-64-x7.html), using OS version 3.04+
* [SC64](https://github.com/Polprzewodnikowy/SummerCollection)

### Extending UNFLoader

This repository has a [wiki](https://github.com/buu342/N64-UNFLoader/wiki) where the tool, its libraries, and the supported flashcarts are all documented. It is recommended that you read through that to familiarize yourself with everything. If you want to submit changes, feel free to fork the repository and make pull requests!


### Known issues and suggestions

All known issues are mentioned in the [issues page](https://github.com/buu342/N64-UNFLoader/issues). Suggestions also belong there for the sake of keeping everything in one place.
